<p>Running a business is a full-time job, and small-to-medium sized businesses (SMBs) in particular can often find their in-house IT resources stretched to capacity. As a result, it’s difficult to devote the necessary time and effort to deploying and managing the latest business technologies.</p>
<p>This is leading an increasing number of companies to outsource part or, in some cases <em>most</em>, of the day-to-day maintenance of their IT operations to third-party providers. Fueled by the growth of cloud computing, IT managed service providers (MSPs) can host and manage customers’ IT infrastructure more flexibly and more efficiently than ever.</p>
<p class="ramp-incontent">But it’s not just SMBs that don’t have the time to manage their in-house IT operations, and so are opting to outsource–there are several reasons why companies are moving in this direction. Whether it’s to lower costs, improve security, scale their IT faster or get a greater return on their investments, an increasing number of organizations are turning to MSPs.</p>
<h3>What Are IT Managed Services?</h3>
<p>The MSP model is based on customers paying on a recurring basis for remote IT services, such as desktop and network management, applications management, remote help desk, and backup and disaster recovery. This means that as a customer, you only incur an operational expense based on your capacity and usage, as opposed to the large upfront capital investments associated with purchasing on-premises infrastructure.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an option that has gained traction in recent years, with smaller companies especially attracted to the model’s fluidity. An April 2018 <a href="http://techaisle.com/managed-services-reports/14-smb-midmarket-managed-services-adoption-trends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey of 1,116 U.S. SMBs by analyst firm Techaisle</a> shows that 46 percent of SMBs currently outsource their IT, and another 29 percent plan to do so.</p>
<p>“SMBs are dealing with an ever-expanding portfolio of increasingly complex applications and platform technologies. At the same time, these firms are struggling to rein in IT-related expenditures, including staff-related costs,” Techaisle’s chief analyst and CEO, Anurag Agrawal, tells Tom’s Hardware.</p>
<p>“This combination of increased reliance on technology as a key element of business success, burgeoning complexity and cost constraint has created a ‘perfect storm’ for use of managed services.”</p>
<h3>Growing Your Business</h3>
<p>Enlisting an MSP takes pressure off your IT department, and by outsourcing the critical day-to-day support and maintenance of your IT estate to an expert, more resources can go toward growing your business. In fact, 46 percent of the SMBs Techaisle questioned said working with an MSP helps them grow their business.</p>
<p>“Many of our SMB customers are trying their best to get out of the IT business,” David Huseonica, president and CEO of Georgia-based MSP <a href="https://cloudag.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloud AG</a>, tells Tom’s Hardware. “With the option of cloud applications and outsourced IT, their attitude on buying, managing and maintaining their own servers has changed in that it is no longer viewed as necessary.”</p>
<p>Larger SMBs, also known as mid-market firms, also often use managed services as a means of augmenting their current staff: for example, delivering on niche specialties or covering standard tasks so that in-house resources can move on to new initiatives.</p>
<h3>Addressing IT Complexity</h3>
<p>A business’ reasoning for hiring an MSP can be as simple as lacking an in-house IT department. Many small companies with just a handful of employees rely on the most ‘technically savvy’ ones to take on the role of help desk when problems arise with devices, software or the network.</p>
<p>But as Estelle Johannes, director of member communities at IT industry association CompTIA, points out, as your company grows and your IT needs become more complex, this won’t cut it. You will either need to look to hire an IT person internally or hire an MSP to take on the management of your network on contract, as you would with any other utility, such as electricity or water.</p>
<p>“Depending on the extent of your IT needs, a full-time, in-house person makes sense if they are utilized consistently with the wages they are being paid. But if your IT needs ebb and flow or are mostly low-grade with few major initiatives, an MSP that offers pricing commensurate with technology usage or consumption might be the more cost-effective way to go,” Johannes told Tom’s Hardware.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/it-cloud-storage-security,5781.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">push to cloud services</a> can also be a factor in deciding to bring managed services to your organization. Cloud AG’s Huseonica tells us that while some companies choose to outsource their IT due to the initial cost savings, that’s not the only driver. Many value the fact outsourcing frees them up to concentrate on other revenue-generating activities for the business. Additionally, the cloud enables them to scale their IT as per their demands.</p>

</div>
<h3>Offloading Day-to-Day IT Management</h3>
<p>Another reason for adopting managed services is to offload routine IT tasks, such as system updates, user help desk and employee changes. These activities don’t necessarily require the highest skill level, but they are constant.</p>
<p>“You may find that your pet development projects seem to drag on and on because the IT department is always busy with keeping devices, networks and security running and up to date,” says Johannes, referencing the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/bimodal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gartner bimodal IT model</a>.</p>
<p>According to Gartner, bimodal IT is the practice of managing two separate, coherent modes of IT delivery, one focused on stability and the other on agility.</p>
<p>“Rather than bring in more highly skilled and highly paid IT staff to take on Mode 1, you can offload the day-to-day tasks to the MSP, leaving in-house IT staff to take on Mode 2 and execute on the business-enabling and revenue-driving digital transformation projects stacking up in their queue,” Johannes explains.</p>
<h3>Filling the Cybersecurity Skills Gap</h3>
<p>IT security is another area where more businesses are turning to MSPs.</p>
<p>“Many companies can’t compete with today’s sophisticated cyber adversaries,” Susie Cummings, SVP of managed services at Chicago-based IT consulting firm, <a href="https://www.swc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SWC Technology Partners</a>, tells us. “To source and hire an in-house security team isn’t an option for many SMBs—it takes a lot of time, isn’t cheap and it’s nearly impossible to find the right combination of skills and expertise—this has led to an increase in outsourced security. As cyberattacks continue to rise, IT security management has become even more complex and expensive.”</p>
<p>Research by Kaseya, which makes software for MSPs, titled <a href="https://www.kaseya.com/resource/2018-state-of-it-operations-for-midsize-enterprises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>2018 State of IT Operations for Midsize Enterprises</em></a>, found that one in three SMBs has experienced a security breach in the last five years and more than one in 10 has experienced one within the last 12 months.</p>
<p>Cummings notes that by outsourcing IT, companies also gain an increased confidence in their ability to prevent or quickly detect and respond to cyber attacks at any time of day.</p>
<p>“Cybercriminals don’t work office hours on Monday to Friday, so having 24/7 / 365 support from security consultants who have expansive practical experience and access to advanced detection technologies helps close those security gaps to protect your customer data and keep your business moving forward.”</p>
<h3>Cost Savings</h3>
<p>Aside from the operational advantages of outsourcing IT, the other big attractions are the financial benefits. With monthly subscription pricing, businesses avoid large upfront costs for new software and servers and move the cost of IT from a capital expense to an operating expense. By offering a predictable monthly subscription plan, organizations know exactly how much they are spending on IT each month and can plan their budgets accordingly.</p>
<p>Plus, you can scale your IT up or down depending on your business’ requirements, offering greater control over your company’s IT environment and reducing needless spend on IT.</p>

<h3>Is Outsourcing for Everyone?</h3>
<p>While the benefits of outsourcing your IT are clear, it may not necessarily be practical to offload the management of all your IT to an outside company.</p>
<p>You may work in an organization that, due to geographic or connectivity reasons, needs to retain at least some of its IT infrastructure on premises: for example, if there is a latency problem moving data between locations. Alternatively, your company’s policy requirements may have established rules around the management of data, often for regulatory and/or data sovereignty reasons, that would make it necessary to keep confidential data or systems on premises.</p>
<p>For these reasons, it’s not practical for most firms to outsource 100 percent of their IT. Many will adopt a hybrid approach to outsourcing, choosing to maintain some systems in-house.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as an IT consumption model, outsourcing continues to prove popular, particularly for small companies. “A substantial and rapidly-growing segment of U.S. SMBs are using some combination of managed services to support IT and business requirements,” says Agrawal, who adds that “the ranks of managed services users are poised to swell further within the next 12-24 months.”</p>

<p>Two recently discovered vulnerabilities in the fax protocol can transform fax machines into entry points for hackers into corporate networks, two Check Point researchers revealed last week in a talk given at the DEF CON 26 security conference held in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Named &#8220;Faxploit,&#8221; this attack targets the ITU T.30 fax protocol, according to a copy of the <a href="https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2026/DEF%20CON%2026%20presentations/DEFCON-26-Yaniv-Balmas-What-The-FAX.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">DEF CON presentation</a>given by Eyal Itkin and Yaniv Balmas last week.</p>
<p>More specifically, Faxploit leverages two buffer overflows in the fax protocol components that handle DHT and COM markers —CVE-2018-5924 and CVE-2018-5925, respectively.</p>
<div id="FIOnDemandWrapper_fiInstance_101902_0_2222114" class="FIOnDemandWrapper">
<div class="apd_static_banner "></div>
</div>
<h2>Fax machines used as entry points into corporate networks</h2>
<p>Itkin and Balmas say that an attacker can send malformed fax images to a fax machine containing code that exploits these two vulnerabilities and then gain remote code execution rights over the targeted device, allowing the hacker to run his own code and take over the machine.</p>
<p>From here, they say that an attacker can download and deploy other hacking tools that scan the local network and compromise nearby devices.</p>
<p>The two researchers have recorded a demo of a Faxploit attack that compromises a fax machine and then uses this machine to download and deploy the EternalBlue exploit that infects nearby computers exposed via the SMB protocol.</p>
<h2>Faxploit carried out via phone lines, not Internet connection</h2>
<p>Itkin and Balmas say the Faxploit attack is dead simple, as a hacker only needs the victim&#8217;s fax number to target an organization.</p>
<div id="FIOnDemandWrapper_fiInstance_101900_3_2222114" class="FIOnDemandWrapper">
<div class="apd_static_banner "><span style="color: #555555; font-size: 14.4px;">Since most organizations print fax numbers on their websites, and Google has indexed over 300 million fax numbers, hackers can use Faxploit to target any organization around the world they want.</span></div>
</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/986406/attacks/Vulnerabilities/faxploit-attack.png" alt="Faxploit attack" width="700" height="306" /></p>
<p>Furthermore, no direct Internet connection is needed to the actual fax machine as the attack code comes in via the phone line. This also makes preventing Faxploit almost impossible, as no security software scans incoming faxes.</p>
<p>The only way to prevent Faxploit attacks is to apply patches to individual fax machines and all-in-one office printers, which also come with an embedded fax machine.</p>
<h2>HP released patches, other fax vendors vulnerable too</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, only HP has addressed Faxploit. The company released <a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c06097712" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">patches</a> last week for HP Officejet all-in-one printers, the fax machine that the Check Point researchers used for recording their demo video.</p>
<p>&#8220;We strongly believe that similar vulnerabilities apply to other fax vendors too as this research concerns the fax communication protocols in general,&#8221; Check Point said today.</p>
<p>But while other vendors test their devices and release patches in the coming months, there is also a way to limit the impact of Faxploit attacks, if they ever happen.</p>
<p>Itkin and Balmas say the simplest defense to neutralize Faxploit attacks is network segmentation. By breaking large corporate networks into smaller ones or by isolating fax machines on their own subnetworks, companies can limit the type of data an attacker can gain access to via this attack.</p>

<h1><strong>[Heads-Up] Warn Your Employees. This Is the Year That Sextortion Spear Phishing Is Skyrocketing&#8230;</strong></h1>
<p>Intrepid cyber-investigative reporter Brian Krebs noticed that a story published on his blog July 12 about a new sextortion-based spear phishing scheme—which uses a real password used by each recipient—had become his most-read piece since his site launched in 2009.</p>
<p>He commented: &#8220;And with good reason — sex sells (the second most-read piece here was my 2015 scoop about the Ashley Madison hack).</p>
<p>But beneath the lurid allure of both stories lies a more unsettling reality: It has never been easier for scam artists to launch convincing, targeted phishing and extortion scams that are automated on a global scale.</p>
<p>And given the sheer volume of hacked and stolen personal data now available online, it seems almost certain we will soon witness many variations on these phishing campaigns that leverage customized data elements to enhance their effectiveness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Krebs is right, this is only the start and most of these passwords were old. Cyber criminals test scams like companies test marketing campaigns and if the response rate is high enough in the beta, they go full-scale.</p>
<h2><strong>The Problem: 50% of Casually Dating Men Watch Porn Weekly</strong></h2>
<p>The Institute for Family Studies recently confirmed what everyone more or less already knew, but since last year there are hard numbers. Men are more likely than women to view pornography, and this is particularly true of viewing porn regularly on a daily or weekly basis.</p>
<p>A whopping 50% of casually dating men watch porn weekly, and this percentage only drops to 40% when they are seriously dating, and 20% for engaged or married.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, looking at this from a &#8220;criminal marketing perspective&#8221; the total addressable extortion market is massive.</p>
<p>Cyber gangs will start using fresh hacks, with recent and real passwords, highly likely combined with other personal data that was sourced from the dark web and appended to the record using big data technology. This method is also going to be used by the tech support scam artists in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost a matter of: &#8220;What took you so long?&#8221;, I have been warning you here for a while that this was imminent.</p>
<h2><strong>Phishing Continues to Be on the Rise in 2018</strong></h2>
<p>The Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) most recent report (link to PDF in blog) covers the phishing trends found in Q1 of 2018.<br />
<a href="https://blog.knowbe4.com/phishing-continues-to-be-on-the-rise-in-2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://blog.knowbe4.com/phishing-continues-to-be-on-the-rise-in-2018 </a></p>
<p>The highlights of the report included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 11,000 phishing domains were created in Q1</li>
<li>The total number of phishing sites increased 46% over Q4 2017</li>
<li>The use of SSL certificates on phishing sites continues to increase to lull visitors into a false sense of security and site legitimacy.</li>
</ul>
<p>All three of these trends add up to one thing – the bad guys are rapidly becoming more sophisticated. The higher the threat levels they can establish through targeted spear phishing attacks which leverage very private information, the more successful the campaign.</p>
<h3><strong><i>I suggest you send the following to your employees. You&#8217;re welcome to copy, paste, and/or edit. You might want to coordinate with HR on this one.</i></strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>Sextortion is a serious internet crime that can lead to devastating consequences for victims. Sextortion occurs when someone threatens to distribute your private and sensitive material if you don’t provide them with images of a sexual nature, sexual favors, or money.</p>
<p>According to the FBI, here are some things you can do to avoid becoming a victim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never send compromising images of yourself to anyone, no matter who they are — or who they say they are.</li>
<li>Don’t open attachments from people you don’t know, and in general be wary of opening attachments even from those you do know.</li>
<li>Turn off [and/or cover] any web cameras when you are not using them.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you receive an email that claims they have video of you viewing pornography, do not answer, delete the scam email and do not pay any amount in any form.</p>
<p>The FBI says in many sextortion cases, the perpetrator is an adult pretending to be a teenager, and you are just one of the many victims being targeted by the same person. If you believe you’re a victim of sextortion, or know someone else who is, the FBI wants to hear from you: Contact your local FBI office (or toll-free at 1-800-CALL-FBI).</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Uptick in Phishing Attempts via XPS file extensions</strong></h1>
<p>We’ve seen it time after time, malicious actors routinely attempt to confuse recipients of messages with obscure or lesser-utilized file extensions.</p>
<p>Over the past month, some phishing attempts using xps files instead of the typical pdf or doc/docx formats have been captured by our filters.  The xps file format is Microsoft’s alternative to pdf files.  Windows machines with Vista or later operating systems natively support this extension with Windows xps file viewer.  Actors have started taking advantage of this lesser-utilized format for their phishing campaigns.</p>
<h2><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1847" src="https://test.infinityns.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Phishing-Image.png" alt="" width="1" height="1" /><strong>Phishing Examples</strong></h2>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.appriver.com/services/spam-and-virus-protection/">SecureTide email filtering</a> has captured a wide range of these phishing messages.  So far, they appear to be attributed to threat actors currently conducting <a href="https://blog.appriver.com/2018/02/office-365-business-email-compromise-attacks-proliferate/">Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks</a>.  Attacks originate from legitimate (compromised) senders with the similar techniques, tactics, and procedures.  Below is an example which could easily dupe unsuspecting users.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone" title="Phishing examples" src="https://blog.appriver.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/msgexample2_compromisedsender-1.png?t=1533578832953&amp;width=666&amp;height=587&amp;name=msgexample2_compromisedsender-1.png" alt="XPS Phishing Example 2" width="438" height="386" /></p>
<h2><strong>Viewing the XPS File</strong></h2>
<p>Users should not open or view unsolicited attachments, even from a known sender without intense scrutiny and/or verification.  Scammers do exploit the trust that known contacts share.  Hopefully a user will never see one of these, however, this is what these attached files look like when opened in an isolated test environment.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone" title="viewing xps file" src="https://blog.appriver.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/xpsfile-1-1.png?t=1533578832953&amp;width=618&amp;height=456&amp;name=xpsfile-1-1.png" alt="Viewing XPS File" width="407" height="300" /></p>
<h2><strong>Linked Phishing Portals</strong></h2>
<p>If the user happens to click on the link in the attached xps file (pictured above), below is an example web phishing portal they might encounter.  For this particular one, the first screen requests their email address.  If they proceed with entering it, the next image shows the resulting page requesting their email credentials.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone" title="linked phishing portals" src="https://blog.appriver.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/xps_1-1.png?t=1533578832953&amp;width=953&amp;height=721&amp;name=xps_1-1.png" alt="Phishing Portal 1" width="588" height="445" /></p>
<h3> After entering email address:</h3>

<h2><strong>Filter Evasion Techniques</strong></h2>
<p>Malicious actors are attempting to use filter evasion techniques.  They break up the suspicious phishing text via canvas clip mappings inside deeply embedded fpage files.  An image portion below displays how they used multiple canvas clip mappings to stitch together the words, “open with your professional email login credentials.”</p>

<h2><strong>Minimal Anti-Virus Signatures for XPS Files</strong></h2>
<p>Most anti-virus engines do not have many phishing rules setup for the xps extensions like they would for more commonly used ones.  We can see this example received 0/60 hits when processed thru a popular anti-virus engine aggregator.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.appriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/vt_0hits.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone" title="minimal anti-virus signatures for xps files" src="https://blog.appriver.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/vt_0hits-1.png?t=1533578832953&amp;width=655&amp;height=121&amp;name=vt_0hits-1.png" alt="VirusTotal 0/60" width="482" height="89" /></a></p>
