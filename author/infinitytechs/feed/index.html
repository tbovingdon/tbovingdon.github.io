										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The largest breach of 2017 may have been even more serious than initially thought: The cybercriminals behind the Equifax hack ac<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1566 alignright" style="font-size: 14.4px;" src="https://test.infinityns.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/equifax-data-breach.png" alt="" width="469" height="264" srcset="https://test.infinityns.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/equifax-data-breach.png 640w, https://test.infinityns.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/equifax-data-breach-600x338.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 469px) 100vw, 469px" />cessed user data not previously disclosed by the company, including tax identification numbers, email addresses, and driver&#8217;s license information, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/equifax-hack-might-be-worse-than-you-think-1518191370">The Wall Street Journal</a> reported.</p>
<ul>
<li>The criminals behind the Equifax breach accessed user data not previously disclosed by the company, including tax identification numbers, email addresses, and driver&#8217;s license information (as described several months ago in a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/equifax-announces-cybersecurity-incident-involving-consumer-information-300515960.html">press rele</a><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/equifax-announces-cybersecurity-incident-involving-consumer-information-300515960.html">ase</a> ) .</li>
<li>The Equifax hack and its aftermath should serve as a wake-up call to enterprises about the importance of strong cybersecurity practices.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Equifax breach, <a href="https://investor.equifax.com/news-and-events/news/2017/10-02-2017-213238821">first disclosed in September 2017</a>, impacted 145.5 million people, compromising their names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, and addresses. The fallout should serve as a wake-up call for enterprises about the consequences of poor security practices, and encourage them to keep up with cyber best practices, TechRepublic contributing writer Matt Asay noted.</p>
<p>The additional data accessed was uncovered by Senate Banking Committee member Elizabeth Warren, after a five-month investigation detailed in a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4376007-Warren-letter-to-Equifax-CEO.html">Friday letter</a> to acting Equifax chief executive Paulino do Rego Barros.</p>
<p>It is not yet clear how many of the 145.5 million people are affected by the ad<span style="font-size: 14.4px;">ditional data accessed, the Journal noted.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We are fully aware — and have been — of the data that was stolen,&#8221; Equifax spokesperson Meredith Griffanti told our sister site <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/hackers-stole-more-equifax-data-than-first-thought/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZDNet</a>.  Griffanti said that the company had always been clear about the data &#8220;primarily included&#8221; in the breach, but that it has recently given the Senate Banking Committee information &#8220;that may have been accessed that we categorized and analyzed in the forensic investigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We sent direct mail notices to those consumers whose credit card numbers or dispute documents with [personal data] were impacted,&#8221; Griffanti told ZDNet.</p>
<p>Equifax&#8217;s response to the breach has been widely criticized: First, the company <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/we-tested-equifax-data-breach-checker-it-is-basically-useless/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">established a data breach checker</a> that was essentially useless. Then, it <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/after-massive-data-breach-equifax-sent-victims-to-fake-phishing-site-for-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted a link</a> to a fake phishing site in an attempt to direct affected customers to their support site.</p>
