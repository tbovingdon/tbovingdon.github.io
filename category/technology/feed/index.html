<p>Running a business is a full-time job, and small-to-medium sized businesses (SMBs) in particular can often find their in-house IT resources stretched to capacity. As a result, it’s difficult to devote the necessary time and effort to deploying and managing the latest business technologies.</p>
<p>This is leading an increasing number of companies to outsource part or, in some cases <em>most</em>, of the day-to-day maintenance of their IT operations to third-party providers. Fueled by the growth of cloud computing, IT managed service providers (MSPs) can host and manage customers’ IT infrastructure more flexibly and more efficiently than ever.</p>
<p class="ramp-incontent">But it’s not just SMBs that don’t have the time to manage their in-house IT operations, and so are opting to outsource–there are several reasons why companies are moving in this direction. Whether it’s to lower costs, improve security, scale their IT faster or get a greater return on their investments, an increasing number of organizations are turning to MSPs.</p>
<h3>What Are IT Managed Services?</h3>
<p>The MSP model is based on customers paying on a recurring basis for remote IT services, such as desktop and network management, applications management, remote help desk, and backup and disaster recovery. This means that as a customer, you only incur an operational expense based on your capacity and usage, as opposed to the large upfront capital investments associated with purchasing on-premises infrastructure.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an option that has gained traction in recent years, with smaller companies especially attracted to the model’s fluidity. An April 2018 <a href="http://techaisle.com/managed-services-reports/14-smb-midmarket-managed-services-adoption-trends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey of 1,116 U.S. SMBs by analyst firm Techaisle</a> shows that 46 percent of SMBs currently outsource their IT, and another 29 percent plan to do so.</p>
<p>“SMBs are dealing with an ever-expanding portfolio of increasingly complex applications and platform technologies. At the same time, these firms are struggling to rein in IT-related expenditures, including staff-related costs,” Techaisle’s chief analyst and CEO, Anurag Agrawal, tells Tom’s Hardware.</p>
<p>“This combination of increased reliance on technology as a key element of business success, burgeoning complexity and cost constraint has created a ‘perfect storm’ for use of managed services.”</p>
<h3>Growing Your Business</h3>
<p>Enlisting an MSP takes pressure off your IT department, and by outsourcing the critical day-to-day support and maintenance of your IT estate to an expert, more resources can go toward growing your business. In fact, 46 percent of the SMBs Techaisle questioned said working with an MSP helps them grow their business.</p>
<p>“Many of our SMB customers are trying their best to get out of the IT business,” David Huseonica, president and CEO of Georgia-based MSP <a href="https://cloudag.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloud AG</a>, tells Tom’s Hardware. “With the option of cloud applications and outsourced IT, their attitude on buying, managing and maintaining their own servers has changed in that it is no longer viewed as necessary.”</p>
<p>Larger SMBs, also known as mid-market firms, also often use managed services as a means of augmenting their current staff: for example, delivering on niche specialties or covering standard tasks so that in-house resources can move on to new initiatives.</p>
<h3>Addressing IT Complexity</h3>
<p>A business’ reasoning for hiring an MSP can be as simple as lacking an in-house IT department. Many small companies with just a handful of employees rely on the most ‘technically savvy’ ones to take on the role of help desk when problems arise with devices, software or the network.</p>
<p>But as Estelle Johannes, director of member communities at IT industry association CompTIA, points out, as your company grows and your IT needs become more complex, this won’t cut it. You will either need to look to hire an IT person internally or hire an MSP to take on the management of your network on contract, as you would with any other utility, such as electricity or water.</p>
<p>“Depending on the extent of your IT needs, a full-time, in-house person makes sense if they are utilized consistently with the wages they are being paid. But if your IT needs ebb and flow or are mostly low-grade with few major initiatives, an MSP that offers pricing commensurate with technology usage or consumption might be the more cost-effective way to go,” Johannes told Tom’s Hardware.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/it-cloud-storage-security,5781.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">push to cloud services</a> can also be a factor in deciding to bring managed services to your organization. Cloud AG’s Huseonica tells us that while some companies choose to outsource their IT due to the initial cost savings, that’s not the only driver. Many value the fact outsourcing frees them up to concentrate on other revenue-generating activities for the business. Additionally, the cloud enables them to scale their IT as per their demands.</p>

</div>
<h3>Offloading Day-to-Day IT Management</h3>
<p>Another reason for adopting managed services is to offload routine IT tasks, such as system updates, user help desk and employee changes. These activities don’t necessarily require the highest skill level, but they are constant.</p>
<p>“You may find that your pet development projects seem to drag on and on because the IT department is always busy with keeping devices, networks and security running and up to date,” says Johannes, referencing the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/bimodal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gartner bimodal IT model</a>.</p>
<p>According to Gartner, bimodal IT is the practice of managing two separate, coherent modes of IT delivery, one focused on stability and the other on agility.</p>
<p>“Rather than bring in more highly skilled and highly paid IT staff to take on Mode 1, you can offload the day-to-day tasks to the MSP, leaving in-house IT staff to take on Mode 2 and execute on the business-enabling and revenue-driving digital transformation projects stacking up in their queue,” Johannes explains.</p>
<h3>Filling the Cybersecurity Skills Gap</h3>
<p>IT security is another area where more businesses are turning to MSPs.</p>
<p>“Many companies can’t compete with today’s sophisticated cyber adversaries,” Susie Cummings, SVP of managed services at Chicago-based IT consulting firm, <a href="https://www.swc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SWC Technology Partners</a>, tells us. “To source and hire an in-house security team isn’t an option for many SMBs—it takes a lot of time, isn’t cheap and it’s nearly impossible to find the right combination of skills and expertise—this has led to an increase in outsourced security. As cyberattacks continue to rise, IT security management has become even more complex and expensive.”</p>
<p>Research by Kaseya, which makes software for MSPs, titled <a href="https://www.kaseya.com/resource/2018-state-of-it-operations-for-midsize-enterprises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>2018 State of IT Operations for Midsize Enterprises</em></a>, found that one in three SMBs has experienced a security breach in the last five years and more than one in 10 has experienced one within the last 12 months.</p>
<p>Cummings notes that by outsourcing IT, companies also gain an increased confidence in their ability to prevent or quickly detect and respond to cyber attacks at any time of day.</p>
<p>“Cybercriminals don’t work office hours on Monday to Friday, so having 24/7 / 365 support from security consultants who have expansive practical experience and access to advanced detection technologies helps close those security gaps to protect your customer data and keep your business moving forward.”</p>
<h3>Cost Savings</h3>
<p>Aside from the operational advantages of outsourcing IT, the other big attractions are the financial benefits. With monthly subscription pricing, businesses avoid large upfront costs for new software and servers and move the cost of IT from a capital expense to an operating expense. By offering a predictable monthly subscription plan, organizations know exactly how much they are spending on IT each month and can plan their budgets accordingly.</p>
<p>Plus, you can scale your IT up or down depending on your business’ requirements, offering greater control over your company’s IT environment and reducing needless spend on IT.</p>

<h3>Is Outsourcing for Everyone?</h3>
<p>While the benefits of outsourcing your IT are clear, it may not necessarily be practical to offload the management of all your IT to an outside company.</p>
<p>You may work in an organization that, due to geographic or connectivity reasons, needs to retain at least some of its IT infrastructure on premises: for example, if there is a latency problem moving data between locations. Alternatively, your company’s policy requirements may have established rules around the management of data, often for regulatory and/or data sovereignty reasons, that would make it necessary to keep confidential data or systems on premises.</p>
<p>For these reasons, it’s not practical for most firms to outsource 100 percent of their IT. Many will adopt a hybrid approach to outsourcing, choosing to maintain some systems in-house.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as an IT consumption model, outsourcing continues to prove popular, particularly for small companies. “A substantial and rapidly-growing segment of U.S. SMBs are using some combination of managed services to support IT and business requirements,” says Agrawal, who adds that “the ranks of managed services users are poised to swell further within the next 12-24 months.”</p>

<p>Two recently discovered vulnerabilities in the fax protocol can transform fax machines into entry points for hackers into corporate networks, two Check Point researchers revealed last week in a talk given at the DEF CON 26 security conference held in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Named &#8220;Faxploit,&#8221; this attack targets the ITU T.30 fax protocol, according to a copy of the <a href="https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2026/DEF%20CON%2026%20presentations/DEFCON-26-Yaniv-Balmas-What-The-FAX.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">DEF CON presentation</a>given by Eyal Itkin and Yaniv Balmas last week.</p>
<p>More specifically, Faxploit leverages two buffer overflows in the fax protocol components that handle DHT and COM markers —CVE-2018-5924 and CVE-2018-5925, respectively.</p>
<div id="FIOnDemandWrapper_fiInstance_101902_0_2222114" class="FIOnDemandWrapper">
<div class="apd_static_banner "></div>
</div>
<h2>Fax machines used as entry points into corporate networks</h2>
<p>Itkin and Balmas say that an attacker can send malformed fax images to a fax machine containing code that exploits these two vulnerabilities and then gain remote code execution rights over the targeted device, allowing the hacker to run his own code and take over the machine.</p>
<p>From here, they say that an attacker can download and deploy other hacking tools that scan the local network and compromise nearby devices.</p>
<p>The two researchers have recorded a demo of a Faxploit attack that compromises a fax machine and then uses this machine to download and deploy the EternalBlue exploit that infects nearby computers exposed via the SMB protocol.</p>
<h2>Faxploit carried out via phone lines, not Internet connection</h2>
<p>Itkin and Balmas say the Faxploit attack is dead simple, as a hacker only needs the victim&#8217;s fax number to target an organization.</p>
<div id="FIOnDemandWrapper_fiInstance_101900_3_2222114" class="FIOnDemandWrapper">
<div class="apd_static_banner "><span style="color: #555555; font-size: 14.4px;">Since most organizations print fax numbers on their websites, and Google has indexed over 300 million fax numbers, hackers can use Faxploit to target any organization around the world they want.</span></div>
</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/986406/attacks/Vulnerabilities/faxploit-attack.png" alt="Faxploit attack" width="700" height="306" /></p>
<p>Furthermore, no direct Internet connection is needed to the actual fax machine as the attack code comes in via the phone line. This also makes preventing Faxploit almost impossible, as no security software scans incoming faxes.</p>
<p>The only way to prevent Faxploit attacks is to apply patches to individual fax machines and all-in-one office printers, which also come with an embedded fax machine.</p>
<h2>HP released patches, other fax vendors vulnerable too</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, only HP has addressed Faxploit. The company released <a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c06097712" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">patches</a> last week for HP Officejet all-in-one printers, the fax machine that the Check Point researchers used for recording their demo video.</p>
<p>&#8220;We strongly believe that similar vulnerabilities apply to other fax vendors too as this research concerns the fax communication protocols in general,&#8221; Check Point said today.</p>
<p>But while other vendors test their devices and release patches in the coming months, there is also a way to limit the impact of Faxploit attacks, if they ever happen.</p>
<p>Itkin and Balmas say the simplest defense to neutralize Faxploit attacks is network segmentation. By breaking large corporate networks into smaller ones or by isolating fax machines on their own subnetworks, companies can limit the type of data an attacker can gain access to via this attack.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;">A NEW PARTNERSHIP WITH LIQUIDFILES</h1>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-1635 size-full" style="font-size: 14.4px;" title="Liquid Files" src="https://test.infinityns.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/liquidfiles_logo_200x39.png" alt="LiquidFiles" width="200" height="39" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Infinity Network Solutions has partnered with LiquidFiles. Our partnership allows us to provide a solution to send and receive large files secur<span style="font-size: 14.4px;">ely, fast, that has ease of use, manageable, flexible and is brandable.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A perfect solution for any professional office that sends large, confidential files. Excellent, competitively priced alternative to paid programs such as Citrix, ShareFile and Dropbox.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em>Features and benefits of LiquidFiles:</em></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Send and Receive Unlimited File Size</strong> — LiquidFiles does not have the very common 2 Gb file size limit common in competing solutions and cloud services. LiquidFiles is limited only by the disk size you assign to it, enabling you to send anything from DVDs to massive CAD drawings without having to worry about file size limitations.</li>
<li><strong>Transfer Speeds</strong>— Running a system on your own network is always going to be faster than a cloud service. When sending multi-gigabyte files, the transfer time can easily be several hours less, being the difference of getting there before close of business today instead of first thing tomorrow morning, like an old-school courier delivery.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> — When something is installed in your own network, in your security perimeter, in your control, with your security configuration. It will always match your security requirements with no questions raised of who might also get access to your secret and sensitive data. With Infinity Network Solution&#8217;s partnership with LiquidFiles you will feel safe that your data is secure.</li>
<li><strong>Branding</strong> — You can make LiquidFiles look like a complete internal solution with your own logos, colour scheme and no LiquidFiles branding on anything that your users, customers or partner sees. Every user visible text string and all emails sent from the system is changeable to your liking. You will look like a pro.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Managing</strong> — LiquidFiles is built to be as easy to use as it can possibly be, and as self-managing as possible. All files sent have an expiration date and will be automatically deleted at the time of expiration. You can assign roles based on LDAP/Active Directory Group belongings and almost all settings are configured on a per group basis and so on. All of this is to make ongoing maintenance a breeze with as little ongoing configuration as possible, leaving more time for you to focus on other things.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a LiquidFiles partner, Infinity Network Solutions enjoy partner pricing and support from LiquidFiles to integrate the solution into our client’s environments to ensure happy joint customers and an overall integrated security capability.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s almost certainly a critical security flaw or two in the device you&#8217;re using to read this story — but you don&#8217;t have to panic.</p>
<p>To varying degrees, the flaws affect processors found in virtually all computers and phones, and could allow an attacker to access data stored in a device&#8217;s memory that should typically remain private.</p>
<p>The researchers announced the discovery publicly this week — calling the two bugs Meltdown and Spectre — and warned the security of everything from passwords and encryption keys to documents and photos could be at risk.</p>
<p>&#8216;One of the worst CPU bugs ever found&#8217;<br />
But while the problem is serious, and an inherent part of how most modern computer processors are designed to function, there are already efforts to minimize the impact and help you get on with your life.</p>
<h3><strong>What do I need to do?</strong></h3>
<p>For most people, the same advice as usual applies: Make sure the applications and operating systems on your phones, laptops, and other devices are up to date.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re using a Mac, iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV, Apple recently rolled out an update that attempts to mitigate the problem, with more fixes on the way, according to the company.</p>
<p>Google says the latest version of Android already contains the necessary fixes, while Microsoft pushed out an automatic update for Windows users Wednesday night.</p>
<p>Computers running Microsoft&#8217;s Windows operating system should automatically receive a software update designed to mitigate the Meltdown flaw disclosed by researchers this week.</p>
<p>PC users will also require a separate CPU update from whoever made their device (for example, Lenovo or HP). &#8220;By the end of next week, Intel expects to have issued updates for more than 90 percent of processor products introduced within the past five years,&#8221; the chipmaker said in a press release.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll also want to update apps like your web browser and anti-virus software when they become available. Developers are beginning to roll out fixes to make it more difficult for sensitive user data to be accessed.</p>
<h3><strong>What are these updates trying to fix?</strong></h3>
<p>The two flaws let attackers access parts of a computer&#8217;s memory that they shouldn&#8217;t normally have access to, by abusing the way that computer processors are designed to handle information more quickly.</p>
<p>One of the flaws, called Meltdown, allowed the researchers to access data stored in the kernel — the core of a computer&#8217;s operating system, which runs in a protected part of a computer&#8217;s memory, and effectively watches over everything your computer does.</p>
<p>By design, applications can&#8217;t access the kernel, a protection that&#8217;s built into the hardware of the CPU itself. But the researchers found a way around that, giving them access to the kernel and, from there, any data stored in a computer&#8217;s memory — which could include everything from passwords to photos. This attack has only been found to work on processors made by Intel.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bug basically melts security boundaries which are normally enforced by the hardware,&#8221; the researchers wrote.</p>
<h3><strong>HOLIDAY SHOPPING</strong></h3>
<p>One of the software flaws identified by researchers only affects processors made by Intel, while the other affects AMD and Intel chips as well. The processors are found in virtually all modern phones, computers, and servers.</p>
<p>The other flaw, called Spectre, allowed researchers to target data that applications store in a computer&#8217;s memory directly (typically, applications can&#8217;t access the memory used by other applications).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s related to Meltdown, but differs in a number of ways that the researchers detail in a pair of technical papers. This attack was found to work on Intel, AMD, and even ARM processors, which are commonly used in mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.</p>
<h3><strong>How would someone attack?</strong></h3>
<p>The same way that most other types of attacks work: by gaining access to your computer.</p>
<p>As such, the usual advice for dealing with malicious software applies here too. Install updates when they become available, and always scrutinize the apps you install, the files you open, and the links you click.</p>
<h3><strong>But everything will be fine now, right?</strong></h3>
<p>Sort of. While Meltdown can be patched, Spectre will be much more difficult to defend against long-term because of the way that CPUs are designed — and that&#8217;s worrying, because it&#8217;s the vulnerability that affects a far wider range of chips.</p>
<p>The researchers say any Spectre-specific software patches for applications, operating systems or CPUs should be considered stopgaps while more research takes place.</p>
<p>&#8220;As it is not easy to fix, it will haunt us for quite some time,&#8221; the researchers wrote.</p>
<p>All of the big cloud providers — Amazon, Google and Microsoft — say their systems have been updated to help prevent Meltdown-style attacks, but customers are being advised to patch their own systems as well.</p>
<p>Who&#8217;s most at risk?<br />
Home users aren&#8217;t at any more risk than usual when new bugs and flaws are discovered, as long as you install your updates.</p>
<p>For cloud computing providers on the other hand, this is a nightmare scenario.</p>
<p>In the cloud, multiple customers typically share the resources of a more powerful computer by running their applications and services in a so-called virtual machines. However, the researchers warn Meltdown can be used to access data from beyond the virtual machine — data from the host computer, or even inside other customers&#8217; virtual machines.</p>
<p>All of the big cloud providers — Amazon, Google and Microsoft — say their systems have been updated to prevent Meltdown-style attacks, but customers are being advised to patch their own systems as well.</p>
<p>Why do these issues even exist?  The researchers sum it up pretty nicely in one of their papers: &#8220;The vulnerabilities in this paper, as well as many others, arise from a longstanding focus in the technology industry on maximizing performance&#8221; — but at the expense of security.</p>
<p>In fact, the flaws detailed by researchers this week are so fundamental to the design of modern processors that the only way to truly prevent any attacks is for Intel, AMD and ARM to redesign their chips. In fact, the Software Engineering Institute&#8217;s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) was especially blunt in its proposed solution: Get a new CPU.</p>
<p>Of course, that&#8217;s not going to be practical for most people and businesses, and so hardware and software companies are attempting to mitigate the two flaws&#8217; effects with software updates the best they can.</p>

<p>Find out how investing in human capital, getting value from data and aligning APIs can help your business transform.</p>
<p>Why is it important for organizations to embrace digital transformation? Ask anyone who used to make their living running a video store, selling encyclopedias or driving a taxi.</p>
<p>Consumer demands haven’t changed much: People still watch movies at home, look up information on obscure topics and need rides around town. But the companies that identified early on how technology would change these industries (Netflix, Google and Uber, among others) are now dominating these sectors.</p>
<p>“The real challenge is how to help your organization align the answers between what business you’re currently in and who you want your customers to become,” says Michael Schrage, research fellow at the MIT Center for Digital Business. “That requires you to think about innovation as something beyond what will make your products or services faster and better. You also need to think about who you want your customers to become and how new technology transforms your customers, not just your business.”</p>
<p>With so many emerging technologies in the marketplace today — often touted as “disruptive” and “transformative” — it can be difficult for executives to discern which will have a tangible impact on the future of their organizations and which will prove to be overhyped.</p>
<p>Schrage offers three organizing principles to help guide organizational strategies around digital transformation: innovations to human capital investments, design of data-driven virtuous cycles and the alignment of application programming interface (API) capabilities.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Focus on Both Employees and Customers</strong></h3>
<p>“If you’re wondering how to collaborate to create more valuable innovation,” says Schrage, “you should begin by asking a new question: ‘How can innovation create more valuable people?’”</p>
<p>The “people” Schrage is talking about include both employees and customers. Of course, technology can dramatically increase productivity among users, allowing them to perform key aspects of their jobs more quickly while often simultaneously improving the quality of their work. But Schrage says enterprises should also try to use technology to create “better customers.”</p>
<p>“We want to use technology not just to help people do a better job at work, or have a better user experience,” Schrage says. “We want to enable them to do better jobs and have better user experiences in ways that make them more valuable to the business, and make the business more valuable to them.”</p>
<p>Schrage says examples of this approach can be found throughout history, including the first mass production of automobiles. Henry Ford didn’t just introduce affordable vehicles to America, Schrage argues; Ford also essentially taught the entire country how to drive.</p>
<p>“I believe the most important innovation [by Ford] was not the mass production of automobiles,” Schrage says. “It was the mass production of driving, the human capital of driving.”</p>
<p>For a more recent — and almost as ubiquitous — example, Schrage points to Google. “What makes Google work?” Schrage asks. “The page rank algorithm. Google doesn’t just search. It creates searchers. Google may be in the search business, but what Google has effectively done is cultivated and harvested the human capital of its users. Everybody essentially works for Google, and they like it.”</p>
<h3><strong>2. Squeeze Value Out of Your Data</strong></h3>
<p>As mobile applications, Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, wearable devices and other digital tools create exponentially more data, organizations risk becoming bogged down with data management processes that don’t create significant value.</p>
<p>“Don’t ask the old IT question, ‘How do we manage 100 times more data?’” Schrage says. “Instead, ask, ‘How do we get the value out of 100 times more data?’”</p>
<p>That value, Schrage says, is often the result of a “virtuous cycle” — the way organizations create data through customer interactions and other processes, use that data to inform and improve their operations, then collect new and better data from those improved processes, and on and on.</p>
<p>For example, Facebook collects and analyzes data from its hundreds of millions of users and then uses that data to fine-tune its user experience. Similarly, Uber collects data on its riders and then uses that data to attract and retain riders, which has led to its explosive growth. Amazon would be worth only a fraction of its current value if its business model were limited to selling items online and then shipping them to customers. Instead, the retailer tracks purchases and product searches, and then uses the resulting data to promote certain products, make recommendations and optimize pricing.</p>
<p>Don Barker, an enterprise collaboration consultant with CDW, notes that data can also help organizations optimize how they’re using their technology solutions. For example, he cites collaboration tools that enable users to meet remotely. “We use the analytic extension on the back end to measure, to ensure that people are using the tools correctly,” he says.</p>
<p>“It’s not just you deliver this, you deliver that,” says Schrage. “Things feed and play off of one another. I think, going forward, our challenges are going to be around what kind of virtuous cycles our technologies are creating, and how we go to our line-of-business counterparts and make the case that we in IT enable a higher return on investment.”</p>
<p>Technology vendors are starting to leverage this data to improve the solutions they deliver. For example, Cisco Systems integrated data analytics into its collaboration solutions to help organizations understand how these tools — and their users — work most productively.</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s an enormous amount of analytical data, very powerful data that you can bring to bear,” says Mark A. Nash, Cisco’s director of strategy and innovation for worldwide collaboration. “You can leverage the data to improve the way your users meet, interact with each other, and collaborate and communicate.”</p>
<h3><strong>3. Use APIs to Make Connections Between Your Business Systems</strong></h3>
<p>APIs are essential to the success of IoT technologies, enabling communication and interaction among different systems. For example, when a homeowner remotely adjusts the temperature of a room in his or her house using a mobile app, the app calls on the API controlling the air conditioning system. Or when an event attendee buys tickets online, an API verifies payment information.</p>
<p>Schrage says APIs are “gateways for turning silo-ized processes into interoperable platforms.” Because of this, he says, compatibility among APIs is crucial to most successful digital transformation strategies.</p>
<p>The more connections organizations can make between systems, the more useful these systems become. For example, Cisco has deployed APIs on its Spark collaboration platform that enable organizations to embed the solution into their own applications. Conversely, an organization’s apps can be embedded into Spark. Either approach allows organizations to create new capabilities that greatly enhance both Spark and native applications.</p>
<p>“You have the ability through the APIs to do anything you want with the solution, including the ability to integrate with anything else,” Nash says.</p>
<p>The more systems rely on these processes, the more important API alignment becomes. “Increasingly, one of the economic and financial variables you will be asked is, ‘How do we assess return on API?’” he says.</p>
<p>As the IoT market matures, the greatest value is likely to come from deployments that synthesize numerous systems and utilize data from each of them, multiplying the impact of the technology.</p>
<p>“APIs enable and facilitate interoperability,” Schrage says. “For larger organizations, most coding is stringing together APIs. That’s going to be true for Internet of Things and for a lot of the processes that businesses are managing these days and into the future.”</p>
